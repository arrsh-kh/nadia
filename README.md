# NADIA ðŸŽ§

NADIA is an open-source real-time spatial audio engine designed for live sound, club systems, and immersive environments. Inspired by systems like L-ISA (L-Acoustics) and Dolby Atmos, but built to be modular, transparent, and free.

## Features (planned)
- Real-time audio routing
- Speaker layout mapping (2D/3D)
- Low-latency DSP core
- Spatialization (VBAP, HRTF, Ambisonics â€” WIP)

## Goals
- Built in C (or C++)
- Lightweight, fast, portable
- Club-ready performance
